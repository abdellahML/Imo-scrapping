## File

```database.csv``` (sep=",") is the result of this scraping.

This file is already filled with more than 10.000 data properties.

```Abdellah_results.csv``` (sep=",") is another result for the scraping of logic-immo.

This file is already filled with more than 5.000 data properties.

## Why

A little exercise to consolidate our knowledges.

## When

It took us three days, from the 18th November 2020 to the 20th November 2020.

## Usage

To install this 

You need to have **Python3**.
Different packages used :
- [Beautifulsoup4](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/);
- [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/).

For "www.immoweb.be" use the ebu function:
```python
from MainEbu import ebu

ebu()
```

For "www.logic-immo.be" use the melvin function:
```python
from Main_Melvin import melvin

melvin()
```

For "www.logic-immo.be" use Abdellah.py.

Just run the code.


**These functions will return 5.000 data each.**
